## 1. DARPA CLARA alignment

### CL-01 — All 10 CLARA gap blocks as synthesisable RTL

**Status:** ✅ done. See [`CLARA_TRACEABILITY.md`](CLARA_TRACEABILITY.md)
for the gap-by-gap mapping. The 10 gap-block modules
(`redteam_filter`, `datalog_engine_mini`, `asp_solver_mini`,
`sat_solver_mini`, `composition_kernel`, `restraint_ctrl`,
`explainability_unit`, `proof_trace_writer`, `audit_log_ring_buffer`,
plus `k3_alu` as the K3 epistemic surface used by Gap-2/4) are all
under `src/` and exercised by Verilog testbenches under `test/`.

**Honesty caveat.** "Gap covered by an RTL block" does not mean "Gap
formally proven". CL-04 is the gate that closes that.

### CL-02 — K3 epistemic surface + refusal demo

**Status:** ✅ done. `BENCHMARKS.md` Demo 2 wires
`redteam_filter → k3_alu → datalog/asp/sat → restraint_ctrl`. K3
truth-table coverage (TRUE / UNKNOWN / FALSE) is exercised in
`test/k3_alu_tb.v` (27/27 cases at last run).

### CL-03 — Proof-trace + audit-receipt + mesh route

**Status:** ✅ done. `BENCHMARKS.md` Demo 3 chains
`explainability_unit → composition_kernel → proof_trace_writer →
audit_log_ring_buffer → crc32_receipt → blake3_anchor →
multi_tile_receipt → d2d_holo_mesh`. The cross-die anchor `0x47C0`
gates the demo at reset (`sim/tb_canonical.v` — 3 PASS, 0 FAIL).

### CL-04 — Formal proofs cross-walked to RTL

**Status:** 🟡 partial. `coq/` and `trios-coq/` directories exist;
`src/fbb_active_path.v` header cites `FBBActive2.v`. A full
gap-by-gap proof cross-walk under `docs/EVIDENCE.md` is a
**target** — listed as an open checklist item in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md). VERIFY: no DARPA CLARA acceptance,
funding, or program date is asserted by this repo.

## 2. Energy efficiency

The "triple-decker" envelope (RBB / FBB-ACTIVE / CAP-BOOST) is
detailed in [`TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md`](TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md). This
section is the planning view; the status file is the evidence view.

### EN-01 — FBB-ACTIVE (0xF2)

**Status:** ✅ RTL present. `src/fbb_active_path.v` is a 4-state FSM
with FBB level localparams 0…400 mV and a leakage-monitor input.
Witness crate `crates/fbb-active-witness/`.

**Caveat — pre-existing testbench mismatch.**
`test/tb_fbb_active_path.v` does **not** compile against the current
`src/fbb_active_path.v` at the time of this snapshot. Iverilog
reports unknown ports `enable`, `temp_mon`, `activity`, and an 8-bit
`fbb_level` connection against a 32-bit RTL port. **Not introduced by
this plan.** Closing this is a follow-up; see
[`TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md`](TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md) §2.1 and §4.

### EN-02 — RBB (0xF1)

**Status:** 🟡 witness-only. `crates/rbb-witness/` pins the parameter
band (`V_BS ≈ −2.5 mV`, leak-save band [35 %, 50 %]). **No
`src/rbb_*.v` exists in this repo.** The plan-to-close-the-gap is
spelled out in [`TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md`](TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md) §4
item 1: land `src/rbb_idle_well.v` + `test/tb_rbb_idle_well.v`.

### EN-03 — CAP-BOOST (0xF3)

**Status:** 🟡 witness-only. `crates/cap-boost-witness/` pins the
parameter band (`ΔC ≈ 0.81 pF`, di/dt margin band [4 %, 10 %]). **No
`src/cap_boost_*.v` exists in this repo.** Plan-to-close in
[`TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md`](TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md) §4 item 2: land
`src/cap_boost_rail.v` + `test/tb_cap_boost_rail.v`.

### Headline TOPS-per-watt numbers

The README cites `75 / 405` TOPS/W as **SKY130A pre-silicon
estimates** (see `README.md` and `STATUS.md`). Any larger figure that
appears in external proposals (e.g. line-wide `1000×` headline,
`4000` TOPS/W ceiling) is `VERIFY` / `projection` only — **not**
asserted by this repo, and not derivable from any artefact in this
tree without a 22FDX (or other) PDK port that has not yet landed
(see [`LINEUP.md`](LINEUP.md) §22FDX projection).

## 3. SNN-TRI fusion (Spiking Neural Networks × Ternary)

γ is the place on the line where the **SNN ↔ ternary** fusion lives:
8 cortical columns with LIF dynamics drive a 20-PE GF16 mesh that
holds BitNet b1.58 ternary weights.

### SN-01 — LIF cortical columns on the mesh

**Status:** ✅ done. `src/cortical_column.v` instantiates LIF
dynamics + BitNet MLP + GF16 dot4 input projection per column. The
local mesh is `src/trinity_quad_mesh.v` + `src/trinity_mesh_2x2.v`
(20 PE total). Eight columns × four CLARA-surface columns = the
32-PE figure quoted in `info.yaml`.

### SN-02 — BitNet b1.58 ternary MLP

**Status:** ✅ done. `src/bitnet_encoder.v` does {-1, 0, +1} → 2-bit
trit encoding. `src/vsa_matmul_8x8.v` / `src/vsa_matmul_16x16.v`
consume the trits. Demo 1 in `BENCHMARKS.md` is the runnable harness.

### SN-03 — GF16 vs bfloat16 NMSE comparison

**Status:** 🟡 protocol committed, harness not yet.
[`GF16_BFLOAT16_NMSE.md`](GF16_BFLOAT16_NMSE.md) pins the NMSE-in-dB
protocol, the input distribution (`N(0, 1)` activations × ternary
weights), the sample-count floor (≥ 10 000), and the schema for a
recorded run. The harness `tools/nmse_gf16_bf16.py` is a **target**
— not yet committed; no `Δ_dB` value is published anywhere in the
tree.

## 4. Publication path

### PUB-01 — Whitepaper / positioning bundle

**Status:** ✅ done at the line-wide level. The TRI-NET stack
provenance bundle is pinned at Zenodo DOI
[10.5281/zenodo.19227877](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.19227877)
(this DOI is cited in `docs/INTERCONNECT_PROTOCOL_V1.md` and
`docs/CROSS_TILE_INTERCONNECT.md`, so it counts as repo-evidenced).
γ-side positioning is in `LINEUP.md` §Whitepaper / value proposition.

### PUB-02 — Workshop paper on the γ compute/mesh substrate

**Status:** 🟡 **target**. A workshop paper on the 8×4 γ-surface
(32-PE ternary mesh + 10 CLARA gaps + D2D routing) is on the
publication track. **No venue, deadline, or acceptance is asserted
by this repo.** Tracking lives outside this tree.

### PUB-03 — Post-silicon measurement paper

**Status:** ❌ gated. Requires SILICON readiness (currently ❌ in
[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md)). When silicon returns, fill `docs/silicon/`
with the measured counterpart of every estimate in `BENCHMARKS.md`,
then submit. No date is claimed.

## 5. Open-source community

### OS-01 — Apache-2.0 + open PDK

**Status:** ✅ done. `LICENSE` is Apache-2.0; `info.yaml` declares
SKY130A; `.github/workflows/gds.yaml` runs OpenLane2 → SKY130A in CI.

### OS-02 — Reproducible `.t27 → RTL → shuttle` flow

**Status:** ✅ done. Format registry under `specs/numeric/*.t27` is
mirrored from [`t27`](https://github.com/gHashTag/t27). CI workflows
exercise the flow on every push.

### OS-03 — Contributor / triage funnel

**Status:** 🟡 partial. CI is public and gates `iverilog` elaboration
+ R-SI-1 + canonical anchor. Contributor doc (`CONTRIBUTING.md`,
triage labels, RFC template) is **not yet committed** — listed as a
follow-up.

## 6. Timeline (γ-side, plan-only — no calendar dates asserted)

The line-wide programme calendar is owned outside this repo. γ-side
ordering of work, expressed as sequencing rather than dates:

1. **Now → next wave.** Land NMSE harness (SN-03), repair
   `tb_fbb_active_path.v` (EN-01 caveat).
2. **After that.** Land `src/rbb_idle_well.v` and
   `src/cap_boost_rail.v` (EN-02, EN-03). These change the GDS hash
   and would be a new shuttle submission.
3. **Gated on silicon return.** Fill `docs/silicon/` with measured
   power, energy, TOPS/W, three demo workloads. Move SILICON gate
   from ❌ to ✅ in `STATUS.md`. Submit PUB-03.
4. **Parallel.** Land `docs/EVIDENCE.md` for CL-04 (formal cross-walk).
   Land `CONTRIBUTING.md` for OS-03.

VERIFY: no calendar date, programme deadline, or funding deliverable
date is claimed by this repo.

## 7. Success metrics (γ-side)

Each metric is paired with the artefact whose existence (or measured
value, post-silicon) decides whether the metric is met. **No metric
in this section is claimed met today unless the artefact column says
✅.**

| Metric | Target (γ-side) | Decided by | Status |
|--------|-----------------|------------|--------|
| All 10 CLARA gaps as RTL | 10/10 | `CLARA_TRACEABILITY.md` | ✅ |
| Canonical anchor stable in sim | `{uio_out, uo_out} = 0x47C0` | `sim/tb_canonical.v` | ✅ (3 PASS, 0 FAIL) |
| R-SI-1 (`*` audit) | no new `*` operators | `tools/check_no_star.sh` | ✅ |
| Triple-Deck levers in γ-side RTL | 3 / 3 | `src/fbb_active_path.v`, `src/rbb_*.v`, `src/cap_boost_*.v` | 🟡 1 / 3 |
| GF16 vs bfloat16 `Δ_dB` published | ≤ 0 dB on BitNet b1.58 | `docs/measurements/nmse_<date>.json` | 🟡 protocol only |
| Coq proofs cross-walked to RTL | 10/10 CLARA gaps | `docs/EVIDENCE.md` | 🟡 not committed |
| Measured silicon TOPS/W | _target only_ | `docs/silicon/` | ❌ gated on silicon return |
| Workshop paper submitted | 1 venue | external tracker | 🟡 target only |

## 9. R5 honesty — what this plan does **not** claim

- ❌ DARPA CLARA acceptance, award, or funding amount.
- ❌ Programme calendar dates, milestone dates, or paper-acceptance dates.
- ❌ Silicon return date or measured TOPS/W. README headline `75 / 405` TOPS/W remain SKY130A pre-silicon estimates per [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md).
- ❌ External `1000×` energy-efficiency claim or `4000` TOPS/W ceiling as a γ-side fact. These appear in line-wide planning material but are not derivable from a checked-in γ-side artefact; treated as `projection` only.
- ❌ DOIs other than the one already pinned in `docs/INTERCONNECT_PROTOCOL_V1.md`. Any new DOI would be a new release artefact.
- ❌ RBB / CAP-BOOST RTL on γ. Both remain witness-only crates (see [`TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md`](TRIPLE_DECK_STATUS.md)).
- ❌ A fixed FBB-ACTIVE testbench. The pre-existing
  `test/tb_fbb_active_path.v` port mismatch is honestly recorded;
  repairing it is a follow-up, not in scope here.
